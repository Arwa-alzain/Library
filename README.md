# Library

IQRAA is a system designed to manage library activities efficiently, providing authentication for logging in, registration for new users, and a user-friendly interface. Managers have the ability to add, delete, and update books, generate return receipts, view borrowing history, edit user profiles, and access system reports. Users, on the other hand, can borrow books, view their borrowing history, and access borrow and return receipts. Additionally, the system sends notifications to users if a bookâ€™s due date is within the next three days or if they have overdue books.
